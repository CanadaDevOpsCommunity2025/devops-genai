For Participants

Steps for getting started and submitting your projects for DevOps Gen AI Hackathon:

1. Provide the name of the project or the team and a repository in this account will be created for your project/team
2. Once the Hackthon starts at 6:00 PM on 1st June 2025, fork your project repository and start working on it in your github account.
3. Only 1 fork is allowed either by the Team leader/Mentor (who has signed up via the google form). The CanadaDevOpsCommunity2025 github account owner will be able to review the person who has forked the repository and any mishaps will result in direct disqualification of the team
4. Have the project completed within the team leader's account or mentor's account and commit the final changes to be uploaded to the CanadaDevOpsCommunity2025 account repository.
5. Commit the changes and final project files before 6:00 PM of 2nd June 2025.
6. After 6:00 PM of 2nd June, no changes will be committed and taken into consideration.
7. Final project files from the CanadaDevOpsCommunity2025 repositories will only be considered. So ensure you have provided all the files including readme, documentation, codes, dashboards, flowcharts, etc. Make sure the project repository is standalone enough for judges to make decision.



For Internal committee 


1. Once the google form has been submitted by the teams, ensure you have the project name or team name to create repositories.
2. Create repository for every project with the name of the project provided in the google form and keep it private until 1st June 2025 6:00 PM.
3. From the google form response, you will have the team leader name and mentor name, when the participants arrive, make note of who will be the main point of contact for submitting the project.
4. When the project repository is being forked by the participants, ensure correct person is forking the project and only 1 fork per person is allowed.
5. If any other person has forked the project, take action by asking the person who has forked and make sure they are not committing any changes.
6. Once the hackathon is close to completion, login to the github account and check for "Pull request" of every repository, check for the name of the account from where we have the pull request and "merge the request". This will ensure all the project files are copied to the CanadaDevOpsCommunity2025 project repository.
7. After 6:00 PM of 2nd June, do not merge any pull request.
8. Ensure before the merging of the pull request, the participants have submitted all the required documents like readme, documentation, codes, dashboards, flowcharts, etc. This is required for project repository to be standalone enough for judges to make decision.
9. Help the participants if they have any issues with committing the changes and sending the pull request from their account.
